# Configuring

All app configuration is specified in [`/public/conf.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/public/conf.yml) which is in [YAML Format](https://yaml.org/) format.

Tips:
- You may find it helpful to look at some sample config files to get you started, a collection of which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/000f712a5ce98f212817d20bc16bab10)
- You can check that your config file fits the schema, by running `yarn validate-config`
- After modifying your config, the app needs to be recompiled, by running `yarn build`  - this happens automatically whilst the app is running if you're using Docker
- It is recommended to make and keep a backup of your config file. You can download your current config through the UI either from the Config menu, or using the `/download` endpoint. Alternatively, you can use the [Cloud Backup](./docs/backup-restore.md) feature.
- The config can also be modified directly through the UI, validated and written to the conf.yml file.
- All fields are optional, unless otherwise stated.

### About YAML
If you're new to YAML, it's pretty straight-forward. The format is exactly the same as that of JSON, but instead of using curly braces, structure is denoted using whitespace. This [quick guide](https://linuxhandbook.com/yaml-basics/) should get you up to speed in a few minutes, for more advanced topics take a look at this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

### Config Saving Methods
When updating the config through the JSON editor in the UI, you have two save options: **Local** or **Write to Disk**.
- Changes saved locally will only be applied to the current user through the browser, and will not apply to other instances - you either need to use the cloud sync feature, or manually update the conf.yml file.
- On the other-hand, if you choose to write changes to disk, then your main `conf.yml` file will be updated, and changes will be applied to all users, and visible across all devices. For this functionality to work, you must be running Dashy with using the Docker container, or the Node server.  A backup of your current configuration will also be saved in the same directory. 

### Preventing Changes being Written to Disk
To disallow any changes from being written to disk via the UI config editor, set `appConfig.allowConfigEdit: false`. If you are using users, and have setup `auth` within Dashy, then only users with `type: admin` will be able to write config changes to disk.

### Top-Level Fields

**Field** | **Type** | **Required**| **Description**

**`sections`** | `array` | Required | An array of sections, each containing an array of items, which will be displayed as links. See [`section`](#section)

### `PageInfo`

**Field** | **Type** | **Required**| **Description**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**`title`** | `string` |  Required | Your dashboard title, displayed in the header and browser tab
**`description`** | `string` | _Optional_ | Description of your dashboard, also displayed as a subtitle

### `appConfig` _(optional)_

**Field** | **Type** | **Required**| **Description**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**`language`** | `string` | _Optional_ | The 2 (or 4-digit) [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for your language, e.g. `en` or `en-GB`. This must be a language that the app has already been [translated](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master/src/assets/locales) into. If your language is unavailable, Dashy will fallback to English. By default Dashy will attempt to auto-detect your language, although this may not work on some privacy browsers.
**`statusCheck`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | When set to `true`, Dashy will ping each of your services and display their status as a dot next to each item. This can be overridden by setting `statusCheck` under each item. Defaults to `false`
**`statusCheckInterval`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | The number of seconds between checks. If set to `0` then service will only be checked on initial page load, which is usually the desired functionality. If value is less than `10` you may experience a hit in performance. Defaults to `0`
**`backgroundImg`** | `string` | _Optional_ | Path to an optional full-screen app background image. This can be either remote (http) or local (/). Note that this will slow down initial load
**`enableFontAwesome`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | Where `true` is enabled, if left blank font-awesome will be enabled only if required by 1 or more icons
**`fontAwesomeKey`** | `string` | _Optional_ | If you have a font-awesome key, then you can use it here and make use of premium icons. It is a 10-digit alpha-numeric string from you're FA kit URL  (e.g. `13014ae648`)
**`faviconApi`** | `string` | _Optional_ | Only applicable if you are using favicons for item icons. Specifies which service to use to resolve favicons. Set to `local` to do this locally, without using an API. Services running locally will use this option always. Available options are: `local`, `faviconkit`, `google`, `clearbit`, `webmasterapi` and `allesedv`. Defaults to `faviconkit`. See [Icons](/docs/icons.md#favicons) for more info
**`auth`** | `array` | _Optional_ | An array of objects containing usernames and hashed passwords. If this is not provided, then authentication will be off by default, and you will not need any credentials to access the app. Note authentication is done on the client side, and so if your instance of Dashy is exposed to the internet, it is recommend to configure your web server to handle this. See [`auth`](#appconfigauth-optional)
**`layout`** | `string` | _Optional_ | App layout, either `horizontal`, `vertical`, `auto` or `sidebar`. Defaults to `auto`. This specifies the layout and direction of how sections are positioned on the home screen. This can also be modified from the UI.
**`iconSize`** | `string` | _Optional_ | The size of link items / icons. Can be either `small`, `medium,` or `large`. Defaults to `medium`. This can also be set directly from the UI.
**`theme`** | `string` | _Optional_ | The default theme for first load (you can change this later from the UI)
**`cssThemes`** | `string[]` | _Optional_ | An array of custom theme names which can be used in the theme switcher dropdown

Use the theme name (lowercase) as the key, for an object including key-value-pairs, with the color variable name as keys, and 6-digit hex code as value. See [Theming](/docs/theming.md#modifying-theme-colors) for more info
**`externalStyleSheet`** | `string`  or `string[]` | _Optional_ | Either a URL to an external stylesheet or an array or URLs, which can be applied as themes within the UI
**`customCss`** | `string` | _Optional_ | Raw CSS that will be applied to the page. This can also be set from the UI. Please minify it first.
**`hideComponents`** | `object` | _Optional_ | A list of key page components (header, footer, search, settings, etc) that are present by default, but can be removed using this option. See [`appConfig.hideComponents`](#appconfighideComponents-optional)
**`allowConfigEdit`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | Should prevent / allow the user to write configuration changes to the conf.yml from the UI. When set to `false`, the user can only apply changes locally using the config editor within the app, whereas if set to `true` then changes can be written to disk directly through the UI. Defaults to `true`. Note that if authentication is enabled, the user must be of type `admin` in order to apply changes globally.
**`enableErrorReporting`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | Enable reporting of unexpected errors and crashes. This is off by default, and **no data will ever be captured unless you explicitly enable it**. Turning on error reporting helps previously unknown bugs get discovered and fixed. Dashy uses [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) for error reporting. Defaults to `false`.
**`disableUpdateChecks`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | If set to true, Dashy will not check for updates. Defaults to `false`.
**`disableServiceWorker`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | Service workers cache web applications to improve load times and offer basic offline functionality, and are enabled by default in Dashy. The service worker can sometimes cause older content to be cached, requiring the app to be hard-refreshed. If you do not want SW functionality, or are having issues with caching, set this property to `true` to disable all service workers.
**`disableContextMenu`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | If set to `true`, the custom right-click context menu will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.

**`icon`** | `string` | _Optional_ | The icon for a given item or section. Can be a font-awesome icon, favicon, remote URL or local URL.
